1️⃣ Resume Quality Score Display
✅ What This Section Should Look Like

Top of Section:
Display Resume Quality Score (1-100%) prominently at the top.
Include a main progress bar showing the overall score visually.
✅ Placement & Layout

Below the main Resume Quality Score, include four individual category scores.
Each category should have:
A title label aligned to the left.
A progress bar aligned to the right, visually representing the score.
✅ Categories and Scoring Breakdown
Each of the four categories represents a specific aspect of resume evaluation. AI should assign a score (1-100) to each, and this score must be reflected in a progress bar next to the category name.

ATS Compliance

Evaluates resume structure, formatting, and ATS readability.
Ensures correct parsing, section headers, and avoidance of tables/graphics.
Example: If ATS Compliance = 80%, the progress bar should fill 80% of its width.
Keyword Density

Measures relevance of industry-specific keywords based on job description trends.
Higher scores indicate good alignment with employer search terms.
Example: If Keyword Density = 60%, the progress bar should fill 60%.
Recruiter-Friendliness

Rates clarity, structure, readability, and engagement.
Ensures bullet points use strong action verbs and quantifiable impact.
Example: If Recruiter-Friendliness = 75%, the progress bar should be at 75%.
Conciseness & Impact

Checks if the resume is concise and avoids unnecessary filler.
Evaluates sentence structure, directness, and effectiveness.
Example: If Conciseness & Impact = 90%, the progress bar should be at 90%.
Implementation & Chain of Thought Reasoning
1️⃣ Why Do We Need a Breakdown?

A single Resume Quality Score is not enough; users need specific guidance on strengths & weaknesses.
Each category score provides actionable insights, allowing users to target improvements efficiently.
2️⃣ Why Use Progress Bars?

Visualizing scores with progress bars makes it intuitive & easy to interpret.
Users can quickly scan which areas need the most improvement.
3️⃣ Why Align Labels Left & Progress Bars Right?

This design keeps the information structured & easy to read.
Aligning labels left makes it clear which category is being assessed.
Aligning bars right makes it easy to compare scores visually.
