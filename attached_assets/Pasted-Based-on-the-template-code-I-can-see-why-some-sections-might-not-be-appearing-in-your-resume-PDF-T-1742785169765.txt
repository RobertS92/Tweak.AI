Based on the template code, I can see why some sections might not be appearing in your resume PDF. There are a few potential issues:

1. **Data Structure Issues**
   The most likely reason is that your data structure doesn't match what the template is expecting. The template looks for sections with specific IDs:

   ```javascript
   const workExperience = sections.find((s: any) => s.id === 'work-experience')?.items || [];
   const education = sections.find((s: any) => s.id === 'education')?.items || [];
   const skills = sections.find((s: any) => s.id === 'skills')?.categories || [];
   const projects = sections.find((s: any) => s.id === 'projects')?.items || [];
   ```

   If your sections have different IDs or structure, they won't be found.

2. **Duplicate Template Sections**
   In your original template, I noticed there were duplicate sections for work experience, education, skills, and projects at the end of the file. This could cause rendering issues where only the first instance is processed.

3. **Empty Data Arrays**
   The template has conditionals like `${education.length > 0 ? ... : ''}` which only render sections if there's data. If these arrays are empty, the sections won't appear.

4. **Structure Mismatch**
   For the skills section, the template expects a specific nested structure:
   ```javascript
   skills = [
     { name: "Category Name", skills: ["Skill1", "Skill2"] },
     // more categories...
   ]
   ```
   If your skills data doesn't match this format, the section might not render correctly.

Here are some debugging steps:

1. **Check your resume data:**
   Add a console.log statement before generating the PDF:
   ```javascript
   console.log("Resume sections:", JSON.stringify(sections, null, 2));
   ```
   This will show you what data is actually being processed.

2. **Verify section IDs:**
   Make sure the IDs in your data match exactly what the template is looking for:
   - 'work-experience'
   - 'education'
   - 'skills'
   - 'projects'
   - 'professional-summary'
   - 'certifications'

3. **Check data structure:**
   For skills specifically, ensure you have:
   ```javascript
   {
     id: 'skills',
     categories: [
       { name: 'Category Name', skills: ['Skill1', 'Skill2'] }
     ]
   }
   ```

4. **Add debugging information to the template:**
   You could modify the template to show what data it's finding:
   ```html
   <div style="color: red;">
     Education data found: ${JSON.stringify(education)}
   </div>
   ```

If these sections should be appearing based on your data, the improved template I provided should fix many of these issues, including removing the duplicated sections and standardizing the structure.
