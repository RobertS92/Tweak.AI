From just these two front-end scripts, **there’s nothing obviously wrong** with how the “Education” section is **merged** or **rendered**. The code **does** handle `education` IDs the same as the other item-based sections. In other words, **no direct bug** jumps out here that would prevent “Education” data from populating.

---

## Potential Reasons It’s Not Being Filled

1. **ID Mismatch** (Server vs. Front End)  
   - The front-end expects a section ID of `"education"` (lowercase).  
   - If the parser returns something like `"Education"` (capital E) or `"educations"`, then your merge logic never sees a match. It’s effectively ignored and never merges into the `"education"` section.  
   - Double-check the server’s JSON. The front end’s code relies on `section.id === 'education'`.

2. **No Items** in the Returned Data  
   - The code merges item-based sections like:
     ```ts
     if (section.id === 'education') {
       return {
         ...currentSection,
         ...section,
         items: section.items ? section.items.map(...) : [],
       }
     }
     ```
   - If the parser’s JSON either:
     - **Has no “education”** section at all, or  
     - **Has “education”** but `items` is `[]` or missing,  
     then you’ll see an empty Education block in the front end.

3. **The Parser Doesn’t Detect Education**  
   - Possibly the server didn’t actually find or parse education data from the resume text. So `data.sections` has no `education` entry or it’s empty.  
   - You can confirm by logging `data.sections` in your front end, verifying if `education` appears and has items.

4. **User Expects a Single-Paragraph but the Code Expects Items**  
   - If your parser returns education data as a single `content` string for “education,” while your front-end is coded to show it as `items: SectionItem[]`, you won’t see the text in the item-based UI. 
   - In that mismatch, the code sets `items = []` because it’s looking for `section.items`.

## Conclusion

- **No direct front-end bug** in these scripts obviously excludes or overwrites education. The code does handle `education` similarly to `work-experience`/`projects`/`certifications`.  
- **Most likely** the server is returning the wrong ID (`"Education"` vs. `"education"`) or no items for that section, so it doesn’t appear filled in the UI. Double-check the **server’s** JSON to ensure it returns something like:
  ```json
  {
    "id": "education",
    "title": "Education",
    "items": [
      {
        "title": "Bachelor of Science, ...",
        "subtitle": "... University",
        "date": "2015 - 2019",
        "description": "Some details...",
        "bullets": []
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
  If that’s **not** what the parser sends, the front end code won’t show anything.
