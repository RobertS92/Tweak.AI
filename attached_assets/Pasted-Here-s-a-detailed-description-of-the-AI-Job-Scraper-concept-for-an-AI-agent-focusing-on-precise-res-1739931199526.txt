     * Work experience
     * Educational background
     * Technical proficiencies
     * Domain expertise
     * Soft skills
     * Career trajectory

2. **Intelligent Matching Algorithm**
   - Advanced scoring mechanism that:
     * Compares resume content against job descriptions
     * Generates a comprehensive compatibility score
     * Filters jobs with a minimum 70% match threshold
     * Considers multiple matching dimensions:
       - Skill overlap
       - Experience relevance
       - Industry alignment
       - Role complexity
       - Potential growth opportunities

3. **Job Discovery Methodology**
   - Multi-source job aggregation from:
     * Professional networks
     * Company career pages
     * Specialized job platforms
     * Industry-specific job boards
   - Real-time job market scanning
   - Continuous background job discovery

4. **Matching Criteria Breakdown**
   - Skill Matching (30% of compatibility score)
     * Direct skill keyword alignment
     * Related skill recognition
     * Skill depth and complexity evaluation
   
   - Experience Relevance (25% of compatibility score)
     * Years of experience
     * Role similarities
     * Industry experience
     * Career progression patterns
   
   - Educational Background (15% of compatibility score)
     * Degree relevance
     * Academic specializations
     * Certifications
   
   - Technical Proficiency (20% of compatibility score)
