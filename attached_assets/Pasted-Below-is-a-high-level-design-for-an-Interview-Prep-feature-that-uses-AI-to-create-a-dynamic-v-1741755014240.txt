Below is a **high-level design** for an *Interview Prep* feature that uses AI to create a dynamic, voice-based practice session for users based on a **job description** they provide. The design intentionally omits code; it focuses on **concepts**, **user flow**, and **AI logic**.

---

## 1. Overview & Goals

**Objective**: Help candidates **practice** interviewing in a simulated environment tailored to a specific **job description**. The feature can:

- **Parse** the user’s job description and identify relevant skills, responsibilities, and potential challenges.  
- **Generate** an AI-driven “interviewer” that asks questions, suggests tasks, or includes coding exercises.  
- **Facilitate voice-based or text-based Q&A** for realistic practice.  
- **Evaluate** responses (optional advanced step) or highlight areas for improvement.

### Key Components

1. **Job Description Intake**: The user uploads/pastes a job description.  
2. **AI Analysis**: The system uses AI to identify key points: required skills, typical tasks, domain context, coding requirements, etc.  
3. **Interview Session**: The system simulates an interviewer, asking domain-specific, behavioral, or coding questions.  
4. **Voice-Based Interaction**: Optionally integrated text-to-speech (TTS) and speech-to-text (STT) for a more **realistic** conversation.  

---

## 2. User Flow

1. **User Enters the Job Description**  
   - The user either **pastes** or **uploads** a file containing the job description.  
   - The interface might have a simple text box or file drop zone labeled “Enter/Upload Job Description.”

2. **AI Parsing & Preparation**  
   - Once the user submits, the system (via AI) **scans** the text for:  
     - **Role Type & Level** (e.g., “Senior Backend Developer,” “Project Manager,” “ML Engineer,” etc.)  
     - **Key Skills** (programming languages, frameworks, domain knowledge, soft skills)  
     - **Responsibilities** (leading a team, writing tests, doing architecture diagrams, etc.)  
     - **Context** (industry domain: finance, gaming, e-commerce, etc.)  
     - **Coding Requirements** (if it sees “coding,” “algorithms,” “technical interviews,” etc., it triggers code exercises later).

3. **Generate Interview Scenario**  
   - Based on the extracted info, the AI constructs an **“Interview Plan”** which can include:  
     - **Initial Introduction** (“Let’s simulate an interviewer from X company in Y domain…”)  
     - **Structured Q&A**: domain knowledge questions, typical job role challenges, behavioral/STAR questions, or system design prompts.  
     - **Coding/Whiteboard** exercises if appropriate (e.g., for software roles).  
     - **Voice or Text** Interaction: user can **opt in** to a voice mode or text mode.

4. **User Enters Practice Interview**  
   - The user **clicks “Start”**.  
   - The system verbally (TTS) or textually **asks** the first question.  
   - The user **responds** verbally or via text.  
   - The system optionally **follows up** with clarifications or deeper-level queries.

5. **Dynamic Q&A**  
   - The conversation can branch based on the user’s answers.  
   - If an advanced skill is mentioned or user expresses strong knowledge in a certain area, the AI can dive deeper.  
   - If the job calls for writing code, the system might show an in-browser code editor or ask the user to verbally walk through a coding solution.

6. **Session Recap & Feedback** (optional advanced feature)  
   - Once the user finishes, the system can summarize the Q&A, highlight strong points, and suggest improvements.  
   - If coding tasks were done, it might also *optionally* provide feedback on code style, correctness, or efficiency.

## 3. Feature Details

### A. Job Description Parsing

- **Keyword Extraction**: The AI looks for repeated or bolded skill terms (like “React,” “AWS,” “Machine Learning,” “Agile,” etc.).  
- **Role-Level Identification**: Terms like “Senior,” “Junior,” “Lead,” “Manager,” or “Executive” help shape the complexity of questions.  
- **Soft Skills**: Identifies phrases like “team player,” “communication,” “stakeholder management,” “problem solving,” etc.

**Implementation Considerations**  
- Could leverage LLMs to produce a structured summary of skills, responsibilities, domain knowledge, etc.  
- The result is a “Profile” object capturing all relevant points for the interview scenario.

### B. Interview Plan Generation

- **System Prompt** to the AI:  
  - “Given these required skills, domain context, and role level, create an interview script with X questions. Also include coding challenges if coding is relevant.”  
- **Question Types**:  
  1. **Behavioral** (STAR method, “Tell me about a time…”).  
  2. **Technical Domain** (data structures, concurrency, relevant frameworks).  
  3. **Coding** (if the job is software-related).  
  4. **Scenario-based** (how to handle conflict, how to approach X problem in the domain).  

- The system might produce an **ordered** list of questions or a conversation tree.

### C. Voice Interaction

- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Convert the AI’s textual questions into audio playback.  
- **Speech-to-Text (STT)**: Convert the user’s spoken answers into text for the AI to interpret.  
- The user can do the entire session verbally, making it more realistic.  
- If the user has a mic and wants real-time feedback, the system might also do partial transcripts.

### D. Coding Exercises

- If the job description indicates programming skills, the system can:  
  - Provide a coding prompt (like “Write a function to reverse a linked list”).  
  - Optionally embed a lightweight code editor.  
  - Or simply ask the user to verbally describe how they would solve a coding challenge.  
- If the user chooses the code editor route, the system might evaluate the solution with test cases or just store it for feedback.

## 4. Potential UI/UX Flow

1. **Upload Page**  
   - “Paste or Upload Job Description”  
   - A big text area or file input  
   - “Analyze Job Description” button

2. **Summary Page**  
   - “We found these skills, responsibilities, domain contexts…”  
   - “Would you like to include a coding portion in your interview?” (checkbox if relevant)

3. **Interview Page**  
   - Side panel or top area shows “Question X of Y.”  
   - Main area is a chat bubble or audio playback.  
   - If voice is enabled, a big “Record Answer” button that captures the user’s voice.  
   - If a coding question arises, a code editor or “Would you like to do a whiteboard approach?”

4. **Feedback/Review**  
   - Summaries of user answers (optional advanced).  
   - Possibly an AI critique or suggestions to improve.  
   - “Retake Interview” or “Focus on X area” quick links.

## 5. Architecture & Data Flow (Conceptual)

1. **Front End**  
   - **Upload** job description to back end.  
   - Once analyzed, front end receives a **structured** set of suggested questions.  
   - For each question, it either **plays TTS** or displays text.  
   - Captures user’s response (voice or text).  
   - Sends user’s response to the back-end (or local LLM logic) to decide the next question or follow-up.

2. **Back End**  
   - **LLM** for analyzing job description and generating interview plan.  
   - **LLM** for dynamic follow-up questions if you want a more *live* approach vs. a static script.  
   - Optionally, store user transcripts for feedback or improvement history.  

3. **Voice Services**  
   - Could integrate an **STT** provider (like Web Speech API or a cloud STT service) to convert user’s speech to text.  
   - Could integrate a **TTS** engine to read AI’s questions out loud.  

4. **Coding Integration**  
   - If needed, a small code execution environment or incorporate a coding sandbox library.  
   - Possibly store the user’s code in ephemeral memory, run tests, produce results.

---

## 6. Possible Future Enhancements

- **Scoring & Analytics**: Provide a numerical or qualitative score for user’s performance (like “You answered 10 questions, 3 correct, 2 partial…”).  
- **Peer Feedback or Mentorship**: Let the user share their session transcript with a friend/mentor.  
- **Video/Avatar Interview**: Show a simple interviewer avatar that lip-syncs TTS for even more realism.  
- **Integration with Calendar**: The user can schedule recurring practice sessions before real interviews.

## 7. Conclusion

This design outlines how a user can **upload a job description** and get a **custom, voice-based or text-based interview simulation**. AI breaks down the role’s requirements, **generates** domain-specific questions, possibly includes coding tasks, and **interacts** with the user in a Q&A flow. By storing each answer or using real-time feedback, the user can refine their interview skills in a controlled, job-specific environment – bridging the gap between typical generic practice and truly **role-targeted** preparation.
