# Instructions for Fixing Interview Simulation Application

## Issue 1: Navigation Problem
Fix the issue where the "Start Interview" button on the interview prep page isn't properly navigating to the interview simulation page:

1. Ensure the button click handler properly uses the navigation function (such as `useNavigate` from React Router)
2. Verify that all required data (resume and job role) is properly stored in state management or localStorage before navigation
3. Check for any preventDefault() calls that might be interrupting the navigation flow
4. Ensure there are no syntax errors in the onClick handler
5. Add proper error handling if required data is missing

## Issue 2: Resume Parsing Progress Indicator
Implement a progress percentage indicator when parsing resumes:

1. Add a state variable to track parsing progress (0-100%)
2. Display a visual progress bar component that updates based on this percentage
3. If your parsing library doesn't provide progress updates, implement a simulated progress:
   - Start at 0% when parsing begins
   - Increment gradually (e.g., every 300ms) up to 90%
   - Set to 100% only when parsing is actually complete
4. Add text showing the current percentage next to the progress bar
5. Style the progress indicator to match your application's design

## Issue 3: Uninitialized Variable Error
Fix the "Cannot access uninitialized variable" runtime error:

1. Add proper initialization for all variables used in the components
2. Implement loading states to prevent rendering components that depend on data before it's available
3. Use conditional rendering with null checks to avoid accessing properties of undefined objects
4. Add try/catch blocks around code that might fail if data isn't loaded
5. Implement graceful error handling with user-friendly messages when data is missing
6. Set default values for all required variables and states
7. Ensure async operations complete before accessing their results

## Implementation Notes
- Ensure your state management is consistent across the application
- Use proper React lifecycle methods or hooks (useEffect) to load data at the right time
- Implement error boundaries to catch and handle unexpected errors
- Add logging to help diagnose issues in production
- Test the navigation flow thoroughly with different scenarios (missing data, slow connections, etc.)
