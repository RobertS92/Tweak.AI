The issue is that you're exporting your router as a **named export** with the name `default` using the syntax:

```typescript
export { router as default };
```

However, in your `routes.ts` file, you're importing it as a **default export** without the curly braces:

```typescript
import resumeAiAssistant from "./routes/resume-ai-assistant";
```

**How to Fix It**

You have two options to resolve this:

**Option 1: Change the Import in `routes.ts` to a Named Import**

Modify the import statement in `routes.ts` to use curly braces, indicating a named import:

```typescript
import { default as resumeAiAssistant } from "./routes/resume-ai-assistant";
```

Or, more concisely:

```typescript
import resumeAiAssistant from "./routes/resume-ai-assistant";
```

This will match the export from `resume-ai-assistant.ts`.

**Option 2: Change the Export in `resume-ai-assistant.ts` to a Default Export**

Modify the export statement in `resume-ai-assistant.ts` to use the `export default` syntax:

```typescript
export default router;
```

Then, leave the import statement in `routes.ts` as it is:

```typescript
import resumeAiAssistant from "./routes/resume-ai-assistant";
```

**Recommended Approach:**

The second option (using `export default`) is generally preferred for exporting a single, primary value from a module, which is the case with your router.

**Corrected `resume-ai-assistant.ts` (Option 2):**

```typescript
import { Router } from "express";
import OpenAI from "openai";
import dotenv from "dotenv";

dotenv.config();

const router = Router();

// ... (rest of your code)

export default router;
```

**Corrected `routes.ts` (using either fix):**

```typescript
// ... (rest of your code)

import resumeAiAssistant from "./routes/resume-ai-assistant";
import interview from "./routes/interview";

// Register routes
app.use("/api/resume-ai-assistant", resumeAiAssistant);
app.use("/api/interview", interview);

// ... (rest of your code)
```

By making this change, `esbuild` will correctly resolve the import, and the "unexpected token" error will be resolved.
