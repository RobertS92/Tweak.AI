# Resume Builder Page Description

## Overview
The Resume Builder page allows users to create a professional resume by either manually entering information or uploading an existing resume for AI analysis and auto-population. The interface is organized into sections with an AI assistant that provides feedback and suggestions for improvement.

## Step-by-Step Functionality

1. **Initial Landing**
   - User lands on a clean interface with the title "Resume Builder" at the top
   - Three main buttons are visible: "Upload Resume", "New Resume", and "Download PDF"
   - The left sidebar shows all available resume sections (Professional Summary, Work Experience, Education, Skills, Projects, Certifications)

2. **Resume Creation Options**
   - **Upload Resume**: User can either select a resume from their saved ones in the database or upload a new file from their computer
   - **New Resume**: Starts with a blank template
   - **Manual Entry**: User can click on any section to begin entering information directly

3. **Resume Information Structure**
   - **Personal Information**: At the top with fields for full name, email, phone, location, and LinkedIn URL
   - **Content Sections**: Each section (Summary, Experience, Education, etc.) is expandable and editable

4. **Section Editing**
   - When a user clicks a section in the sidebar, that section becomes active and highlighted
   - The AI assistant analyzes the current content of the selected section
   - For sections like Work Experience, Education, Projects, and Certifications, users can add multiple entries with fields for:
     - Title/Position/Degree
     - Organization/Company/School
     - Date Range
     - Description
     - Bullet Points (with ability to add more)

5. **AI Assistant Functionality**
   - Lives in a card at the bottom of the page (can be minimized)
   - When a section is selected, the AI automatically analyzes that section
   - Provides specific feedback and suggestions for improvement
   - Presents clickable suggestion buttons that auto-apply improvements
   - Allows the user to type questions about the currently selected section
   - Responds conversationally to user inquiries
   - Can make changes to content upon user request (e.g., "Make my summary more concise")

6. **Resume Parsing**
   - When a resume is uploaded, the system parses it to extract:
     - Personal information (name, contact details, etc.)
     - Professional summary
     - Work experience entries with details
     - Education history
     - Skills
     - Projects
     - Certifications
   - All extracted information populates the appropriate fields in the form
   - If parsing fails for any section, it remains empty for manual entry

7. **AI-Assisted Improvements**
   - For each selected section, the AI offers suggestions like:
     - Stronger action verbs for experience bullet points
     - More concise phrasing for summary
     - Better formatting for skills presentation
     - More impactful descriptions of accomplishments

8. **Final Actions**
   - User reviews all sections and makes final edits
   - When satisfied, user clicks "Download PDF" to generate a formatted resume
   - The system produces a professional-looking PDF document with all the entered information

## AI Assistant Interaction Examples

1. **For Professional Summary**:
   - "Your summary effectively covers your background but could be more impactful. Consider highlighting your key achievements more prominently."
   - "Would you like me to rewrite this with stronger opening language?"

2. **For Work Experience**:
   - "I notice your bullet points start with passive language. Would you like me to revise them with stronger action verbs?"
   - "You could add more metrics to demonstrate the impact of your work. For example: 'Increased sales by 20%'"

3. **For Skills**:
   - "Your skills section could be better organized by grouping related skills. Would you like me to categorize them?"
   - "Consider adding proficiency levels to your technical skills to give employers better context."

The resume builder combines intuitive form functionality with intelligent AI assistance to help users create more effective, professional resumes with minimal effort.
